# PPGtk: the polyploid pop-gen toolkit

PPGtk is a program for the analysis of population genomic data collected in polyploids.

Information for installing and running PPGtk can be found [here](http://pblischak.github.io/ppgtk).

### Current features:
 - Estimate per-site allele frequency under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium [`freqs` model].
 - Estimate per-site inbreeding/diseqiulibrium coefficient and allele frequency [`diseq` model].


### To do:

In the near future, I hope to add these models to the software:

 - [ ] Estimate subgenome allele frequencies for allopolyploids [`alloSNP` model]. See my Evolution 2016 slides for a description of the model: [link](https://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.3436619.v1).

 - [ ] Genotype estimation.

 - [ ] Use genotype likelihoods instead of read counts.
